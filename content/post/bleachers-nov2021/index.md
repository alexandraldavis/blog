About two weeks ago I attended my second show since pre-COVID times. I was delighted to see Bleachers 
for a third time, the first two shows dating back to 2017.

As many know, Jack Antonoff busies himself with a myriad of side 
projects, including those with Lorde, Taylor Swift, and Lana Del Rey. 
Yet he and his band, Bleachers, eventually released their third album, 
_Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night_ (_TTSOOSN_), earlier this year. It 
is not difficult to find critical reviews of the album among some 
praise.

I think some people's disappointment stems from an issue not specific to 
Bleachers but rather one ubiquitous throughout the music industry: it felt 
like the entire album was released before its official release date. 
Streaming services have transformed how we listen to music and 
subsequently how much is released, mostly for the worse in my opinion.

But back to this new release. Unhappy diehard fans felt cheated out of 
new music given the new album's length and considering that even one of 
the non-singles, "Strange Behavior," is a cover of a song from one of 
Jack's previous projects. I sense that some Bleachers supporters felt 
cheated of an entirely new album that they expected and deserved after a 
long drought of new content; some concluded that Jack has clearly become 
too involved with his other projects.

Although _Gone Now_ is by far my favorite Bleachers album, I still enjoy 
listening to _TTSOOSN_. Thematically, the album resonates with me -- "Stop 
Making This Hurt" and "What'd I Do With All This Faith?" stand out. I 
also appreciate the sound but recognize that the 80s synth pop/rock can 
polarize people. I adore "Don't Go Dark." Upon first listen, the 
chronology of the tracks felt unbalanced, but now it makes sense to me. 
The music videos created for _TTSOOSN_ hypnotized me, particularly those 
for "Chinatown" and "Stop Making This Hurt." That's saying a lot, 
considering that I am not usually enthusiastic about music videos and 
seldom watch them more than once if at all.

Regardless of how I felt about the album, I was stoked to attend another 
show, and Bleachers felt like the right group for my second dive back 
into live music.

A new venue out in Chesterfield hosted the band, which made me rent a 
car for the occasion. Not my favorite thing to do when I could easily 
commute to a show at Delmar Hall or The Pageant for free, but I must 
admit that the show being in Chesterfield rather than in St. Louis 
proper elicited a joke or two from Jack on-stage. One of my favorite 
highlights of the night was when Jack called Chesterfield "Chesterfuck," 
which felt appropriate.

I was fourth in line and was presently surprised to befriend some fellow 
fans. That was definitely not the case at the Foxing show a couple 
months ago. Getting into the pit was easy and more or less anxiety-free. 
Claud, the opener, was great.

I am still trying to acclimate to this city's different type of crowd. I 
find that St. Louis crowds are much tamer than those in Chicago. It 
was also strange that this date on the tour did not sell out. I must say 
I have been to many fabulous shows that also did not sell out, and I 
realize the pandemic and the venue's location may play a role. However, 
it was not difficult to tell that the show did not sell out. Bleachers 
is always a blast in concert, and most of the fans on the barricade, 
like me, engrossed themselves in the music and the band's presence. But 
the rest of the pit seemed dead. What did not help the case was that the 
seated balcony area brimmed with the venue's middle-aged VIP holders who 
showed up to the show simply because they could yet did not know who 
Jack was. It was disappointing to feel like the energy was lacking 
during "Don't Take The Money" and "Don't Go Dark."

But that's all on the crowd and other factors not related to the band. 
Bleachers still poured their hearts out and, all in all, had a great 
time. It never gets old seeing Jack and Evan's side-by-side stage 
presence while Evan blares his saxophone, and Jack's personality never 
fails to shine. It was fun to hear some of the new songs live and even 
some older ones that I did not expect them to play, such as "Foreign 
Girls." The crowd even managed to coerce Jack into playing a few 
reprises of "Dream of Mickey Mantle," which accentuated my nostalgia for 
the second time I saw Bleachers live in 2017 -- a magical, unforgettable show that 
culminated in my meeting Jack afterwards.

Artists touring again indicate to me a world slowly returning to 
"normal," and I am thankful Bleachers is among them. I need to work on 
writing about these experiences sooner afterwards.
