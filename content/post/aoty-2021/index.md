Two weeks ago I felt like a little kid on Christmas Eve, anticipating 
the greatest gift. I, cocooned in my bed, stayed awake so that I could 
listen to _Draw Down The Moon_ (_DDTM_) in full as soon as the album became 
available. _Pitchfork_ rated it a "meh" 6.0. Well, at least that's a little 
more forgiving than Anthony Fantano's scathing review of the band's 
sophomore album, _Dealer_.

To say I was excited for _DDTM_ would be an understatement. I was already 
on a high after Bleachers released _Take The Sadness Out of Saturday 
Night_, but this was different. I will preface this review by saying that 
I adore everything Foxing releases -- yes, even _Dealer_. I cannot recall 
how I stumbled upon Foxing's work in the first place, unfortunately. 
Though I do remember it being sometime between _Dealer_ and _Nearer My God_ 
(_NMG_), so probably around 2017, or my second year of college. Conor 
Murphy's voice may polarize some listeners, yet it grasped me just as 
much as the band's painfully relatable emo lyrics and math rock 
undertones.

As a college student, I was lucky enough to see the band three times 
during my time in Chicago: the first time at a Lincoln Hall show, the 
second at a sold-out Thalia Hall show, and, finally, at a weird daylight 
block festival at Wrigley Field the night before I would leave my 
favorite city and move to Saint Louis, Foxing's hometown, for graduate 
school.

Foxing rolled out half of _DDTM_ by the time the album was finally 
released on August 6th. While I cannot say I like it when bands 
gradually release half of the record in the months leading up to the big 
day, I also understand the reasons. Streaming services have mostly for 
the worse changed how we listen to music. I can see why bands may feel 
there is no alternative strategy. Conor has discussed at length how 
boring he finds today's music releases; in response, the band rolled out 
the album in a series of online "rituals" that further echoed the 
album's Dungeons and Dragons influences and, of course, all the hard work 
invested in the album itself and music videos.

The band is not too shy to reveal insecurities. Others told them years 
prior they would be an "arena band," yet Foxing remains middle class at 
best, its members barely staying afloat in a city with a low cost of 
living. Previous members Josh Coll and Ricky Sampson left the band for 
what sounds like primarily financial reasons. The band and their fans 
expect some sort of breakthrough and were even surprised that  _NMG_, despite its universal acclaim from music critics, did 
not skyrocket the group's success. One potential reason for this is 
Foxing's desire to wear many hats; each of their albums seems to only 
polarize their hard-earned fanbase more. Foxing experiments with a 
variety of sounds, often going against the grain of what hardcore emo 
and indie rock fans, among the other niches to whom Foxing caters, each 
unanimously want. _DDTM_ is no exception.

I cherished _DDTM_'s singles before the album's release, especially "If I 
Believed in Love," which I streamed endlessly during my Chicago trip and 
remains one of my favorite tracks.

The singles, as good as they were alone, make much more sense within the 
album as a whole. The dualism of the album's opener, "737," lets us know 
we are in for a wild ride: mellow tunes many Foxing fans already know 
and love against a heavy cataclysm that literally introduces the rest of 
the album in its final verse. I cannot think of a better way to open the 
album.

"Go Down Together" remains the fun and wholesome track it was after its 
pre-release. The tune feels light and airy, echoing "Heartbeats" from 
_NMG_, though more sing-alongable. It is hard to not like this track. It 
seems almost the exact opposite of "737" -- no surprises and not as dark. 
But it still works, especially lyrically, as Conor opened up on what he 
aimed to address on this album: cosmic insignificance. To some it may 
sound like just another indie rock song, but it was genuinely one of the 
most fun songs I experienced live (more on that in an upcoming post).

The third track, "Beacons," blew me away upon first listen. New music 
usually needs to grow on me before I treasure it, but this was something 
else. I never imagined Foxing would experiment with this sound. I have 
listened to this song on repeat for an embarrassing number of hours at a 
time ever since I heard it at midnight on August 6th. The song is about 
sexuality. Thematically, this is a great juxtaposition to many of the 
songs on _Dealer_, which address Catholic guilt. Some suspected Conor's 
bisexuality given the band's music video for "Night Channels," but he 
never publicly stated so until 2018. Eric, Foxing's guitarist, explained 
that Conor seemed like a much more confident person after coming out, 
and this song affirms that notion. I could ramble about how amazing this 
song is but would not do it justice. Anyone who has ever been burdened 
with some type of shame will like this one.

"Draw Down the Moon" and "Where The Lightning Strikes Twice" were also 
pre-released singles, and I prefer the former. The title track sounds 
like a blend _NMG_ and the rest of the songs on _DDTM_ yet still classically 
Foxing. I cannot exactly pinpoint why, but "Where The Lightning Strikes 
Twice" does not do much for me. Neither its sound nor its lyrics are 
bad, but I have not been able to connect with it.

"Bialystok" is a sweet track about homesickness, named after a Polish 
city and the farthest away the band has ever played from their hometown. 
The song wrestles with glimmering soft sounds and an indie feel that 
fits right in with other songs on the album. I love that they named the 
track after a place, yet the lyrics "arguing in the kitchen just to be 
the one that you argue with" epitomize the entire album thematically: 
our relationships with those around us harbor great meaning, despite 
increasing nihilism in our dumpster fire world.

"At Least We Found The Floor" sounds like it will be another clich√© indie folk wannabe acoustic track. Even if it were, I 
would still love it. But it's more than that. Its lyrics have positive 
undertones about hitting rock bottom, calling out a past incident where 
Foxing's $30,000 worth of band equipment was stolen. But much like "737" 
deceives the listener, this song, too, surprises when the outro hits you 
with "it's gonna get much worse than this."

Surprisingly, what stood out the least to me after my first few listens 
of the album, "Cold Blooded," grows on me more each day. It's epic live, 
and how can anyone dislike the line about Mahlon Layne?

"If I Believed in Love" is my other favorite track from the album, and I 
honestly knew it even before the album was released in full. I resonated 
with its lyrics on the first listen. The song builds up very much like 
"Grand Paradise" on _NMG_; the way Conor sings "I'd unattend my mind" on 
the former sends me chills like the latter's iconic "shock-collared at 
the gates of heaven" line. Another song I cannot do justice by writing 
about it -- go listen to it.

"Speak With The Dead" weirded me out a bit when the band chose to 
pre-release it, the closing track, as the first single. Again, the 
build-up to something awesome, namely Eric's guitar solo, and Conor's 
final, somber "there you are" close out the song, and now also the 
album, amazingly.

Foxing is one of the most hard-working bands, if not the most, and this 
album and its production show that. Even if _DDTM_ is not what _Pitchfork_ or diehard fans of _The Albatross_ wanted, Foxing hammers home their 
versatility yet again not only with respect to a single album but also their 
entire discography. Foxing is ambitious but never strays too far from 
home, as their trademark emo lyrics remain the forefront. This album 
already means everything to me. _Pitchfork_ is silly.
