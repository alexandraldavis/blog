I wanted to dump here all of the photos I've accumulated this fall, as 
it appears the season is coming to a close. It is almost December, and 
soon St. Louis will experience its first snowfall like many other cities 
around the country already have.

Fall is by far my favorite season; I am so thankful that I took better 
advantage this year of Missouri's nature opportunities both in St. Louis 
and outside of it. Compared to last fall, I am in a much better place 
mentally. Autumn inspired me to dust off my fancy camera for the first 
time in ages. I neglected photography for most of my time here so far, 
even though it is one of my favorite hobbies.

Some of the following photos were taken with my Pixel, while others were 
taken with my Fujifilm XT10.

The trees and view at Bluff View Trail were stunning. Not a strenuous 
hike by any means, but the colors made this a special hike on Halloween.

I've frequented Tower Grove this season. Forest Park is great, but I 
think TG's vibe better suits me. It didn't seem like the trees peaked 
yet here even in early November.

Last weekend I visited both Forest Park and Tower Grove Park (again). I 
think these photos show fall's climax in the St. Louis area. Here are 
the photos I took in Forest Park.

And finally the photos from my latest stroll through Tower Grove Park.
