Recently the CDC loosened its face mask guidelines, and my 
university now allows those who are fully vaccinated to work maskless in 
less-trafficked spaces. I will continue wearing a mask, given that we do 
not know for certain whether the vaccines protect against variants and 
for how long vaccine-induced immunity lasts. However, my reasons stretch 
beyond protecting those around me.

Yesterday I wore a mask for about seven hours, not unlike any 
other day since summer 2020 when I resumed working in person. It's a 
relief every day to remove it, though I've upgraded masks to decrease 
discomfort.

I exited the Metro on that unusually chilly May evening, encountering 
the freedom only a Friday can elicit as well as a command I almost 
forgot that I dodged for much of the pandemic: being told to smile. I 
kid you not that it took less than ten seconds after exposing my face's 
lower half for a transit employee to insist I smile, without hesitation. 
Of course the employee was male.

I could write for hours on how much this pisses me off. But it also 
pisses me off because I simply ignored him. Then again, I doubt older 
men will learn that women like myself do not exist to look pleasant for 
them. Don't tell me what to do. Even if I am happy and simply choose to 
not express that physically, I do not owe you a smile.

I also have never understood why most Americans smile in public so much. 
If my eyes accidentally meet a stranger's on public transit or on the 
streets, I avert. Awkward. I always sympathize with eastern Europe's 
"non-smiling culture" because otherwise I feel smiling loses its 
authenticity. Russians find smiling *at* something rather than *about* 
something peculiar, so much so that it indicates stupidity or 
questionable intentions.

Maybe I don "resting bitch face" more than others because of this. 
**Regardless of the reason, I need a reason to smile, and being told to do 
so is never one of them. A mask protects me from this.**

Unfortunately facial recognition is growing more commonplace, even 
during a pandemic. Now everyone's face mask selfies improve its 
technology.

I learned in the fall that I more than likely fell victim to Facebook's 
malicious photo-tagging technology when I still lived in Illinois, a 
state whose law, the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), prohibits 
tech companies from harvesting personal biometric data without 
permission. While I am pleased I may receive $345 from the settlement, I 
also scoff at Facebook "buying out" my privacy, especially when the 
payouts are pennies to them.

**Biometric surveillance sucks. So, more reason to wear a mask, even if masks offer only slightly more 
friction for these companies than without.**
