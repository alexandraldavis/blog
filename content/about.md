Hi, I'm Alexandra. Thank you for visiting my personal blog. 

I currently live in Saint Louis, where I am pursuing a PhD in biomedical engineering. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2019 with my 
bachelor's in molecular engineering and a minor in Germanic studies.

I have many interests outside of the lab, including music, reading, photography, foreign 
languages, physical fitness, philosophy, travel, and digital privacy. After college I started 
itching to revive non-scientific writing, so expect posts on these topics and more.
